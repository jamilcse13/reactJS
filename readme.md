### React elements:
* react
* react DOM
* element
* component:
    * various tags itself a component. like: img, div, p etc


* React uses diffing or reconciliaion algorithm
    - In this ways, before and after changes considers like a tree, components like the nodes in this tree
    - If we change anything, then react just modifies the changes not the whole tree
    - It makes the operation faster here

- Sometimes React performs less than Vanila Js or Jquery. But this is not too much. User Experience, performence, coding quality, large scale project management, with these considerations, React is better than others.
- React makes Developer Experience (Dx) much better
